# Master-PDF-Editor_Install-OCR-Languages.md

## Problem
Master PDF Editor (Free-Version 4.3.89-1) was unable to install additional OCR languages, returning errors related to 
DNS resolution and SSL certificate issues.

## Steps to Resolve

### 1. Update DNS Settings

#### Edit `/etc/resolv.conf`

1. Open the file in a text editor:
   
   `sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf`

3. Update it with the following nameservers:
   
```
# Generated by NetworkManager
search fritz.box
nameserver 1.1.1.1                # Cloudflare IPv4
nameserver 208.67.222.222         # OpenDNS IPv4
nameserver 2606:4700:4700::1111   # Cloudflare IPv6
nameserver 2620:119:35::35        # OpenDNS IPv6
options edns0 trust-ad

```
   
* Save and exit (CTRL + O, then Enter, CTRL + X).

* **NOTES:**
	* `search fritz.box`:
		* The `search` option allows DNS lookups for unqualified hostnames (like `printer` instead of 
		`printer.fritz.box`) by appending the specified domain, in this case, `fritz.box`. This is helpful for 
		resolving devices on your local network using just their hostname.

	* `options edns0 trust-ad`:
		* `edns0` enables Extension Mechanisms for DNS, which allows for larger UDP message sizes and better handling 
		of DNS extensions.
		* `trust-ad` is used to trust DNS responses that contain the `Authenticated Data (AD)` flag. This flag is set 
		when DNS responses are verified as authentic (particularly relevant with DNSSEC).

3. Set `/etc/resolv.conf` to Immutable
 
To prevent further changes by `systemd-resolved`:

    `sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf`

### 2. Disable `systemd-resolved`

1. Stop the service:
   
    `sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved`

3. Disable it from starting on boot:
   
    `sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved`

### 3. Update `/etc/hosts`

1. Open the hosts file:
   
	`sudo nano /etc/hosts`

3. Comment out or remove any lines that direct `get.code-industry.net` to `127.0.0.1` or `0.0.0.0`:
   
	`# 0.0.0.0 get.code-industry.net`

### 4. Install or Update CA Certificates

1. For Arch Linux systems, ensure you have the `ca-certificates-utils` package installed and/or updated:
   
	`sudo pacman -S ca-certificates-utils`

3. To update the certificate store, run:
   
	`sudo trust extract-compat`

### 5. Test DNS and Server Connection

1. Verify DNS resolution:
   
	`nslookup get.code-industry.net`

* Output:
  
```
Server:         1.1.1.1
Address:        1.1.1.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   get.code-industry.net
Address: 176.99.6.191
```

2. Verify Ping:
   
	`ping get.code-industry.net -c 5`

* Output:
  
```
PING get.code-industry.net (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.032 ms
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.038 ms
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.038 ms
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.038 ms
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=0.038 ms
```

3. Test `curl` with the correct URL:
   
	`curl -I http://get.code-industry.net`

* Output:
  
```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Date: Sat, 26 Oct 2024 12:02:55 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Connection: keep-alive
```
4. If encountering SSL issues, use:
   
	`curl -Ik https://get.code-industry.net`

* Output:
  
```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Date: Sat, 26 Oct 2024 13:17:25 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Connection: keep-alive
```

### 6. Browser Testing

Test the URL in a web browser. If you see a self-signed certificate warning, you can proceed by accepting the risk. If 
you receive a `403 Forbidden` error, it may indicate server-side access restrictions.

## Conclusion

After following the steps above, you should be able to install additional OCR languages in Master PDF Editor without 
issues. See [pictures](Pictures/).
